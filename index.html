            <li>1 1/2 cups Daawat Basmati Rice, rinsed and soaked</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>
              1 bulb of garlic, cut the top off to expose the cloves of garlic
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>3 cups hot water (to cook the rice)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Heat oil in a large pot. Add the beef in the oil in batches making
              sure not to over crowd the pot. You want to sear the beef so it
              browns and not steams. Let cook for 3-4 minutes until browned on
              all sides.
            </li>
            <li>Add the onions and stir for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>
              Add the carrots, season with salt & pepper, chili powder, pilau
              masala and bay leaves and stir. Let cook for another 1-2 minutes
              or until the carrots soften.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add hot water (to cook the beef), cover the pot with a lid and let
              simmer for 45 minutes-1 hour until the meat is very tender.
            </li>
            <li>
              Layer the rice onto the meat, season with some more salt, pour in
              the hot water (to cook the rice) and let simmer uncovered for
              10-12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprinkle coriander powder onto the almost cooked rice and push the
              bulb of garlic into the rice making sure that the exposed cloves
              are submerged in the rice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cover and reduce the temperature and let sit for 12-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the bulb of garlic and bay leaves from the rice, and serve
              the pilau immediately.
